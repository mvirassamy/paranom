# Paranom - Decentralized NFT Marketplace

**Paranom** is my first decentralized application (dApp) project, developed in mid-2023 as an exploration into Web3 technologies. This project combines an NFT marketplace with an exclusive messaging system, where NFT owners gain access to a private decentralized channel.

## 🌟 Overview
